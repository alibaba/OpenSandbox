class Volume:
    """Storage mount definition for a sandbox. Each volume entry contains:
    - A unique name identifier
    - Exactly one backend struct (host, pvc, etc.) with backend-specific fields
    - Common mount settings (mountPath, readOnly, subPath)

        Attributes:
            name (str): Unique identifier for the volume within the sandbox.
                Must be a valid DNS label (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens allowed, max 63 chars).
            mount_path (str): Absolute path inside the container where the volume is mounted.
                Must start with '/'.
            host (Host | Unset): Host path bind mount backend. Maps a directory on the host filesystem
                into the container. Only available when the runtime supports host mounts.

                Security note: Host paths are restricted by server-side allowlist.
                Users must specify paths under permitted prefixes.
            pvc (PVC | Unset): Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim mount backend. References an existing
                PVC in the same namespace as the sandbox pod.

                Only available in Kubernetes runtime.
            read_only (bool | Unset): If true, the volume is mounted as read-only. Defaults to false (read-write).
                 Default: False.
            sub_path (str | Unset): Optional subdirectory under the backend path to mount.
                Must be a relative path without '..' components.

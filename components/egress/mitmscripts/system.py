# OpenSandbox egress system addon.
#
# Always loaded by the egress mitmproxy launcher. Stays transparent on the
# wire (does not add or alter headers that would reveal the proxy to peers).
#
# Behavior:
#   Forces streaming for SSE / chunked responses so each chunk is forwarded
#   immediately, bypassing the stream_large_bodies=10m buffer set in config.yaml
#   (which otherwise stalls LLM-style small-chunk streams).
#
#   Implements SNI-aware ignore_hosts for transparent mode. mitmproxy's
#   built-in ignore_hosts check in transparent mode matches against the
#   destination IP first; the SNI hostname is only available inside the TLS
#   ClientHello, which arrives after the initial check. This addon re-checks
#   the same ignore_hosts patterns against the SNI hostname at the
#   tls_clienthello layer and sets ignore_connection=True when a match is
#   found, ensuring domain-based TLS pass-through works reliably.
#
# User-defined addons can be loaded alongside this script via
# OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_MITMPROXY_SCRIPT.
